      <h4>Event Bubbling:</h4>
      <p>When Angular attaches event handlers to standard HTML element events, the event propagation works in the same way as standard DOM event propagation works. This is also called event bubbling. Events on child elements are propagated upwards, and hence event binding is also possible on a parent element, as follows:</p>
