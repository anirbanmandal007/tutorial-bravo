      <h5>Classical Inheritance:</h5>
      <p>In Classical Inheritance, Objects are still abstractions of real world 'things', but we can only refer to Objects through Classes. Classes are a Generalization of an object. In other words, Classes are an abstraction of an object of a real world thing. (Classes, then, are an abstraction of an abstraction of a real-world thing). Since a Class is yet another reference to (or abstraction of) its predecessor, each descendant child Class increases the level of abstraction, thus increasing the level of generalization.      </p>

      <h5>Prototypal Inheritance:</h5>
      <p>As opposed to Classical Inheritance, Prototypal Inheritance does not deal with increasing layers of abstraction. An Object is either an abstraction of a real-world thing, same as before, or is a direct copy of another Object (in other words, a Prototype). Objects can be created from thin air, or they can be created from other objects:
