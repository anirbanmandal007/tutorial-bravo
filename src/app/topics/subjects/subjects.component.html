      <h2>What are different type of subjects in angular? What is Practical Use of it? Please Provide Examples</h2>
      <hr>

      <p>
        Subjects are used for multicasting Observables. This means that Subjects will make sure each subscription gets the exact same value as the Observable execution is shared among the subscribers. You can do this using the Subject class. But rxjs offers different types of Subjects, namely: BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject and AsyncSubject.
      </p>
      <p>The real power of subjects comes into play with multicasting, where a subject is passed as the observer to an observable, which will mean that, when the observable emits, the data is multicasted to all of the subject’s subscriptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>BehaviorSubject</b>: One of the variants of the Subject is the BehaviorSubject. The BehaviorSubject has the characteristic that it stores the “current” value. This means that you can always directly get the last emitted value from the BehaviorSubject.
          There are two ways to get this last emited value. You can either get the value by accessing the .value property on the BehaviorSubject or you can subscribe to it. If you subscribe to it, the BehaviorSubject will directly emit the current value to the subscriber. Even if the subscriber subscribes much later than the value was stored.There are two ways to get this last emited value.

          <li><b>ReplaySubject</b>: The ReplaySubject is comparable to the BehaviorSubject in the way that it can send “old” values to new subscribers. It however has the extra characteristic that it can record a part of the observable execution and therefore store multiple old values and “replay” them to new subscribers.
            When creating the ReplaySubject you can specify how much values you want to store and for how long you want to store them. In other words you can specify: “I want to store the last 5 values, that have been executed in the last second prior to a new subscription”.</li>
            <li><b>AsyncSubject</b>: While the BehaviorSubject and ReplaySubject both store values, the AsyncSubject works a bit different. The AsyncSubject is aSubject variant where only the last value of the Observable execution is sent to its subscribers, and only when the execution completes.</li>
      </ul>
